   * Gets file data for particular offsets. The range list is modified in place; it is then
   * returned (since the list head could have changed). Ranges are replaced with cached ranges.
   * In case of partial overlap with cached data, full cache blocks are always returned;
   * there's no capacity for partial matches in return type. The rules are as follows:
   * 1) If the requested range starts in the middle of a cached range, that cached range will not
   *    be returned by default (e.g. if [100,200) and [200,300) are cached, the request for
   *    [150,300) will only return [200,300) from cache). This may be configurable in impls.
   *    This is because we assume well-known range start offsets are used (rg/stripe offsets), so
   *    a request from the middle of the start doesn't make sense.
   * 2) If the requested range ends in the middle of a cached range, that entire cached range will
   *    be returned (e.g. if [100,200) and [200,300) are cached, the request for [100,250) will
   *    return both ranges). It should really be same as #1, however currently ORC uses estimated
   *    end offsets; we do in fact know in such cases that partially-matched cached block (rg)
   *    can be thrown away, the reader will never touch it; but we need code in the reader to
   *    handle such cases to avoid disk reads for these "tails" vs real unmatched ranges.
   *    Some sort of InvalidCacheChunk could be placed to avoid them. TODO
   * @param base base offset for the ranges (stripe/stream offset in case of ORC).
